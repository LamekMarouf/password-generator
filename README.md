# Password Generator

## Description

This project is a password generator that we were told to make. When you open the page and click generate password, the website prompts you on how long you want your password. After that, it confirms you if you want to have lowercase letters, capital letters, numbers and special characters. After all four confirm prompts are answered, it prints out a randomly generated password in the text box below.
